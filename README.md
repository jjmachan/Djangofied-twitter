# Djangofied-twitter
me no django, me build twitter in django, me learned django!

I wanted to learn Django and be really good at it so I thought I'd build something like twitter with it. The idea 
is to replicate as much as I can functionally in Twitter and hopefully become better at building stuff with
Django.

This is a good exercise for people (like me) starting to learn/build things or
learn a framework etc. (This)[https://github.com/muzam1l/tclone] is a really
good clone that has the front-end and the back-end APIs.
